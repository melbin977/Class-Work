            Climate change is a pressing issue that affects our planet in numerous ways. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, melting ice caps, and sea-level rise are just some of the consequences of climate change. It's crucial to raise awareness about these issues and take action to mitigate the impacts.

        <h2>In Rural Areas</h2>
        <p>
            In rural areas, waste management can be a significant challenge due to limited resources and infrastructure. Often, open dumping or burning of waste is the common practice, leading to environmental pollution. Implementing sustainable waste management practices, such as composting and recycling, can help mitigate these issues.
        </p>
        <h2>In Urban Areas</h2>
        <p>
            Urban areas generate vast amounts of waste, requiring advanced waste management systems. Recycling, waste-to-energy plants, and efficient collection methods are essential in urban areas to reduce the environmental impact of waste. Proper waste management is vital to maintaining a healthy environment in cities.
